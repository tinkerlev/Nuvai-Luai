# 🛠️ Contributing to Nuvai

🗓️ Version: 1.0 | Last updated: May 2025 | Status: Early-stage (Alpha)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Nuvai**!

**Nuvai** is an open-source smart static code analysis engine (SAST), built with a security-first mindset and penetration tester thinking, combined with AI principles and ISO 27001 standards.

Nuvai focuses on identifying security vulnerabilities, exposed secrets, dangerous functions, malicious patterns, and sensitive paths — even in code generated by AI or No-Code / Low-Code platforms.

Your participation makes a real difference.
Whether you're an experienced developer, a cybersecurity expert, a tester, or just curious — you are welcome here.

## 🧪 Help Us Test Nuvai's Early Versions

At this early stage, testing the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** is especially valuable.
You can help by:

* Running scans on your own codebases (or sample projects).
* Checking how Nuvai handles AI-generated or No-Code output.
* Trying different programming languages: Python, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, TypeScript, C++, and more.
* Noting any false positives, missed vulnerabilities, crashes, or unclear messages.

Even basic feedback like "it worked" or "it failed with this error" is extremely helpful.

We are shaping Nuvai together — your input matters!
